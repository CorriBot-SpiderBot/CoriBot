# SpiderBot - Rescue & Surveillance
This project deals with the design, construction and control of a walking spider bot which comprises object following and path tracking capabilities using object detection algorithms making it the best available alternative for rescue operation. In addition, it can be used for surveillance purposes in the defense sector as it stands out from the existing systems.
This bot can be controlled and monitored from a user interface program which can also display data from the sensors, along with an autonomous working mode.
